# Chess AI

The goal of this project was to implement a functional chess AI that a player or another AI can play against.

## Featured Components

This project makes use of the Minimax algorithm for AI move selection. This allows for it to visualize future moves that it and its opponent can make. An additional pruning stage is used to remove un-optimal move paths and improve overall AI efficiency.
